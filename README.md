# Language.Framework
<p>
  This framework can be useful for creating programming language
  It has two basic classes subsystems: 
  <ul>
    <li>Scanner</li> 
    <li>Parser</li>
  </ul>
  At the moment it is not finished fully yet and can be changed any moment
</p>
<p>Directory "./sources" shows usage of the framework</p>
<p>Others directories are subsystems of the framework</p>

# Scanner subsystem
<p>Scanner itself has two basic methods: Scan(input: string) and AddHandler(handler: Scanner.Handler)</p>
<p>Method AddHandler(handler: Scanner.Handler) adds handler to scan input (this process can be customized by user)</p>
<p>Method Scan(input: string) scans input</p> 

# Parser subsystem [DEVELOPMENT]
<p>Parser itself has one basic methods: Parse(input: string)</p>
<p>At the moment this subsystem is not finished and is in development</p>
<p>So usage of this subsystem is not recommended, because it can change unexpectedly</p>
